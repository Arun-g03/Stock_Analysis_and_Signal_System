Stock Analysis and Signal Generating System
Purpose
The purpose of this system is to analyze historical stock data, identify patterns and indicators, and generate trading signals based on rule-based strategies and machine learning models. The system aims to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions by providing accurate and timely trading signals.

Goal
The primary goals of this system are:

To load and preprocess historical stock data from various sources.
To initialize and compute various technical indicators and chart patterns.
To generate trading signals using both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches.
To provide visualization tools for historical data, indicators, patterns, and trading signals.
To backtest the trading strategies and evaluate their performance.
System Overview
1. Data Handling
The system can load historical stock data from multiple sources:

CSV files: Load data from local CSV files.
Yahoo Finance: Fetch historical data using the yfinance library.
Alpaca API: Fetch historical data using the Alpaca trading API.
2. Feature Engineering
The system computes various technical indicators and chart patterns, which are then used as features for generating trading signals:

Indicators: Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, etc.
Patterns: Higher Highs and Lower Lows, Double Top, Head and Shoulders, Cup and Handle, etc.
3. Model Training
The system trains machine learning models to predict trading signals:

RandomForestClassifier: Used for training a model based on historical features and their corresponding signals.
4. Signal Generation
The system generates trading signals using:

Rule-Based Methods: Simple conditions based on indicators and patterns.
Model-Based Methods: Predictions from the trained machine learning model.
Consensus Signals: A combination of rule-based and model-based signals.
5. Backtesting and Evaluation
The system backtests the generated trading signals on historical data to evaluate the performance of the trading strategies.

6. Visualization
The system provides visualization tools to plot:

Historical stock price data.
Indicators and patterns.
Buy/Sell signals.
Backtesting results and balance over time.
